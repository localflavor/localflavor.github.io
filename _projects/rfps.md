description: I created this artwork as part of an RFP for a marketing campaign for the State of Colorado. The client came to me with the “Meet the Farmer” campaign idea and together, we came up with the ideas for the types of collateral that could help to connect people with their local food producers. The only existing artwork for the campaign was the Colorado Proud logo.
