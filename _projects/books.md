description: Books projects are always really fun. I get to work with people who are excited about what they are creating and are always delighted when they finally get to hold the finished product in their hands. Having designed and printed a couple of my own books, I know the feeling — and I’m always honored to be part of that process. I offer design services for the cover artwork as well as the pages of the book and any necessary supporting artwork.
