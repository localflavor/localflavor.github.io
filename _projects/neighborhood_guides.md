description: From 2007 through 2015, I partnered with the Mile High Business Alliance to create a series of neighborhood guides to showcase the local businesses in those neighborhood. With a ridiculous turn around time from concept to print in 4 weeks, we produced 4 guides. And as soon as those first 4 guides hit the streets, they became wildly popular with business owners and shoppers -- resulting in 20 subsequent guides. Following the success of the neighborhood guides, we collaborated on Local Coffee and Local Beer guides.
